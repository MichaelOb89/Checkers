# Checkers

*Checkers Rules*
## Starting the game ##
* Click the button *Click here to start game* to position the pieces.
* Each player starts with 12 discs on the dark colored squares of the board
* Black starts the game and players will alternate turns.
## Moving Pieces ##
* The pieces always move diagonally and single pieces (non kings) are always limited to forward moves.
* A piece making a non-capturing move may move only one square.
### Capturing Pieces ###
* To capture a piece of your opponent, your piece leaps over one of the opponent's pieces and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. This landing square must be empty.
* When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
* Only one piece may be captured in a single jump, but multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.
* If a player is able to make the capture, then the jump must be made.
* Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).
## Upgrading to King ##
* When a piece reaches the furthest row, it is crowned and becomes a king.
* Kings are limited to moving diagonally but can move both forward and backward.
* Kings may combine jumps in several directions (forward and backward) on the same turn.
## Game Ending ##
* A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move.
* This happens usually because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.
